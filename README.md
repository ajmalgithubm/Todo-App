Here's a breakdown of the main features and components of a typical ToDo app built with React.js:

Task Component: This is a basic component that represents a single task. It consists of a task title, a checkbox to mark the task as completed, and an option to delete the task.

Task List Component: This component is responsible for rendering the list of tasks. It maintains two separate lists: one for pending tasks and another for completed tasks.

Add Task Component: This component contains an input field where users can enter a new task and an "Add" button to add it to the task list.

State Management: The app uses React's state to manage the tasks. The task list and its status (completed or pending) are stored in the component's state.

Event Handlers: Event handlers are used to respond to user interactions. For example, when the user clicks the "Add" button, a function is triggered to add the new task to the list.

Display Pending and Finished Tasks: The app displays the pending tasks and the finished tasks in separate sections. Each task is rendered using the Task Component mentioned earlier.
